A simple decryption tool for substitution ciphers.
****
**You need to manually do the decrypting itself, this tool only helps you keep track of the progress you've made.**
****
# How to use
Just simply paste the string of text you want to decrypt into the *file_to_be_decrypted.txt* and run the software. It
will provide you with a frequency table, in *frequency_table.txt*, and you can start your decryption from there. Once you are
done, the solution will be saved into the *decoded_file.txt*.

*Disclaimer:* The script is somewhat based on this one: https://github.com/Brendan-Kirtlan/Minecraft-file-encoder
and was only developed as somewhat of a challenge for myself.
